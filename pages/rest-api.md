REST for representational state transfer are a way to access and manage web resources using
stateless operations like Read, Add, Modify, and Delete. In developing RDF Application APIs,
REST operations are mapped to the common HTTP Verbs of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for URLs.


<blockquote class="blockquote bg-default">
<p>&hellip; a RESTful API ends up being simply a collection of URIs, HTTP 
calls to those URIs and some JSON and/or XML representations of resources, 
many of which will contain relational links. The RESTful principal of 
addressability is covered by the URIs. Each resource has its own address or 
URIâ€”every interesting piece of information the server can provide is exposed 
as a resource. The constraint of uniform interface is partially addressed by the 
combination of URIs and HTTP verbs, and using them in line with the standards 
and conventions.</p>
<p>
In deciding what resources are within your system, name them as nouns as opposed 
to verbs or actions. In other words, a RESTful URI should refer to a resource 
that is a thing instead of referring to an action.
